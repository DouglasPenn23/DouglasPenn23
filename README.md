- 👋 Hi, I’m Douglas Pennington!

- 👀 I’m interested in Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, Spring & learning new languages/frameworks. I consider JavaScript to be my best language.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more effective methods & ways to use/build API's. I have also taken an interest in GUI's. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that interest me & I have the skill set for.

- 📫 You can reach me at DouglasPennington2013@gmail.com
